# My addition: lets you reset (with, e.g., `mon reset init`) if SRST
# (DCD on the FT232R) is connected to the RUN pin on the Pi. (it'll
# pull the pin low, which resets the Pi)

# Lots of sources didn't figure out that you can do this 'fake SRST'
# connection

# they claim that the Pi JTAG doesn't expose SRST, and they use a
# manual button or whatever. I guess it's true that the Pi's RUN pin
# is not a proper SRST pin that's speced as part of its JTAG
# interface, but it does the same thing? it's mentioned here

# worked for them, and it works for me
